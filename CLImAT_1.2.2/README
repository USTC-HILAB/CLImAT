/********** CLImAT **********/

Detection of copy number alteration and loss of heterozygosity in 
impure and aneuploid tumor samples using whole-genome sequencing data.

(1)If you have Matlab installed in your machine, you are golden. Run CLImAT according to the following instructions.

Usage: 
CLImAT(dataDir, outputDir, genotypeDir, configFile);
CLImAT_plot(dataDir, outputDir, plotDir);

Arguments:
	dataDir:              The directory containing files generated by DFExtract
	outputDir:            The directory to save CLImAT results
	genotypeDir:          The directory to save genotypes of SNPs
	plotDir:              The directory to save the plots of every tumor sample
	configFile:           The configuration file containing user-defined parameters

Example:
	CLImAT('./data', './results', './genotype', 'config.txt');
	CLImAT_plot('./data', './results', './plots');

CLImAT quick start, to run CLImAT on a test data, use command:
example()

(2)If Matlab is not installed in your machine, please refer to "readme.txt" file in "executables" directory to learn details of using CLImAT.
